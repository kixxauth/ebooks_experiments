The relatively unrestricted circulation of information and (revolutionary) ideas transcended borders, captured the masses in the Reformation and threatened the power of political and religious authorities; the sharp increase in literacy broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging middle class. Across Europe, the increasing cultural self-awareness of its people led to the rise of proto-nationalism, accelerated by the flowering of the European vernacular languages to the detriment of Latin's status as lingua franca.[13] In the 19th century, the replacement of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press by steam-powered rotary presses allowed printing on an industrial scale,[14] while Western-style printing was adopted all over the world, becoming practically the sole medium for modern bulk printing.
</r><r ri='10'>The invention of improved movable type mechanical printing is credited to Johannes Gutenberg in 1450[3] although earlier versions are described in the history of printing. The exact date of Gutenberg's press is debated based on existing screw presses. Gutenberg, a goldsmith by profession, developed a printing system by both adapting existing technologies and making inventions of his own. His newly devised hand mould made possible the rapid creation of metal movable type in large quantities. The printing press displaced earlier methods of printing and led to the first assembly line-style mass production of books.[4] A single Renaissance printing press could produce 3,600 pages per workday,[5] compared to about 2,000 by typographic block-printing[6] and a few by hand-copying.[7] Books of bestselling authors like Luther orErasmus were sold by the hundreds of thousands in their lifetime.[8]
</r><r ri='11'>Printing soon spread from Mainz, Germany to over two hundred cities in a dozen European countries.[9] By 1500, printing presses in operation throughout Western Europe had already produced more than twenty million volumes.[9] In the 16th century, with presses spreading further afield, their output rose tenfold to an estimated 150 to 200 million copies.[9] The operation of a press became so synonymous with the enterprise of printing that it lent its name to a new branch of media, the press.[10] The importance of printing as an emblem of modern achievement and of the ability of so-called Moderns to rival the Ancients, in whose teachings much of Renaissance learning was grounded, was enhanced by the frequent juxtaposition of the recent invention of printing to those of firearms and the nautical compass.[11] In 1620, the English philosopher Francis Bacon indeed wrote that these three inventions "changed the whole face and state of the world".[12]
</r><r ri='12'>A fourth development was the early success of medieval papermakers at mechanizing paper manufacture. The introduction of water-powered paper mills, the first certain evidence of which dates to 1282,[30] allowed for a massive expansion of production and replaced the laborious handcraft characteristic of both Chinese[31]and Muslim papermaking.[32] Papermaking centres began to multiply in the late 13th century in Italy, reducing the price of paper to one sixth of parchment and then falling further; papermaking centers reached Germany a century later.[33]
</r><r ri='13'>The rapid economic and socio-cultural development of late medieval society in Europe created favorable intellectual and technological conditions for Gutenberg's invention: the entrepreneurial spirit ofemerging capitalism increasingly made its impact on medieval modes of production, fostering economic thinking and improving the efficiency of traditional work-processes. The sharp rise of medieval learning and literacy amongst the middle class led to an increased demand for books which the time-consuming hand-copying method fell far short of accommodating.[16]</r><r ri='14'>Gutenberg greatly improved the process by treating typesetting and printing as two separate work steps. A goldsmith by profession, he created his type pieces from a lead-based alloy which suited printing purposes so well that it is still used today.[24] The mass production of metal letters was achieved by his key invention of a special hand mould, the matrix.[25] The Latin alphabetproved to be an enormous advantage in the process because, in contrast to logographic writing systems, it allowed the type-setter to represent any text with a theoretical minimum of only around two dozen different letters.[26]
</r><r ri='15'>Block printing first came to Christian Europe as a method for printing on cloth, where it was common by 1300. Images printed on cloth for religious purposes could be quite large and elaborate, and when paper became relatively easily available, around 1400, the medium transferred very quickly to small woodcut religious images and playing cards printed on paper. These prints were produced in very large numbers from about 1425 onward.</r><r ri='16'>At the same time, a number of medieval products and technological processes had reached a level of maturity which allowed their potential use for printing purposes. Gutenberg took up these far-flung strands, combined them into one complete and functioning system, and perfected the printing process through all its stages by adding a number of inventions and innovations of his own:

</r><r ri='29'>Printing</r><r ri='3'>Early modern wine press. Such screw presses were applied in Europe to a wide range of uses and provided Gutenberg with the model for his printing press.
</r><r ri='30'>Section 1</r><r ri='31'>Section 2</r><r ri='4'>The screw press which allowed direct pressure to be applied on flat-plane was already of great antiquity in Gutenberg's time and was used for a wide range of tasks.[17] Introduced in the 1st century AD by the Romans, it was commonly employed in agricultural production for pressing wine grapes and (olive) oil fruit, both of which formed an integral part of the mediterranean and medieval diet.[18] The device was also used from very early on in urban contexts as a cloth press for printing patterns.[19] Gutenberg may have also been inspired by the paper presses which had spread through the German lands since the late 14th century and which worked on the same mechanical principles.[20]
</r><r ri='5'>Gutenberg adopted the basic design, thereby mechanizing the printing process.[21] Printing, however, put a demand on the machine quite different from pressing. Gutenberg adapted the construction so that the pressing power exerted by the platen on the paper was now applied both evenly and with the required sudden elasticity. To speed up the printing process, he introduced a movable undertable with a plane surface on which the sheets could be swiftly changed.[22]
</r><r ri='6'>A printing press is a device for evenly printing ink onto a print medium (substrate) such as paper or cloth. The device applies pressure to a print medium that rests on an inked surface made of moveable type, thereby transferring the ink. Typically used for texts, the invention and spread of the printing press are widely regarded as among the most influential events in the second millennium[1] revolutionizing the way people conceive and describe the world they live in, and ushering in the period of modernity.[2]</r><r ri='7'>Despite this it appears that the final breakthrough of paper depended just as much on the rapid spread of movable-type printing.[34] It is notable that codices of parchment, which in terms of quality is superior to any other writing material,[35] still had a substantial share in Gutenberg's edition of the 42-line Bible.[36] After much experimentation, Gutenberg managed to overcome the difficulties which traditional water-based inks caused by soaking the paper, and found the formula for an oil-based ink suitable for high-quality printing with metal type.[37]
</r><r ri='8'>The concept of movable type was not entirely new in the 15th century; sporadic evidence that the typographical principle, the idea of creating a text by reusing individual characters, was well understood and employed in pre-Gutenberg Europe had been cropping up since the 12th century and possibly before. The known examples range from Germany (Prüfening inscription) to England (letter tiles) to Italy.[23] However, the various techniques employed (imprinting, punching and assembling individual letters) did not have the refinement and efficiency needed to become widely accepted.
</r><r ri='9'>Another factor conducive to printing arose from the book existing in the format of the codex, which had originated in the Roman period.[27] Considered the most important advance in the history of the book prior to printing itself, the codex had completely replaced the ancient scroll at the onset of the Middle Ages (500 AD).[28]The codex holds considerable practical advantages over the scroll format; it is more convenient to read (by turning pages), is more compact, less costly, and, in particular, unlike the scroll, both recto and verso could be used for writing − and printing.[29]
